# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
MechaCar Production Data Review

# Project Overview
This project is about AutoRUs' newest prototype, that is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress. The upper management called in data analytical team to review the production data. Data analytics team will do the following:

•	Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes

•	Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots.

•	Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population.

•	Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, you’ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.
